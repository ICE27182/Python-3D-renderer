# Python-3D-render
## It is a pure python program aiming to render 3D objects with some basic version
Don't ask me Y, but I just decided not to use any thirdparty library and it's pure python, so
it would be slow

the program runs in terminal and all images you see are text(usually â–ˆ) using the print function

Logic behind the code is mostly based on @javidx9's Code-It-Yourself! 3D Graphics Engine Part
