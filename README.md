# Python-3D-renderer

## It is a program written in pure Python aiming to render 3D objects with some very basic features.

Don't ask me why, but I just decided not to use any thirdparty library. Given that it's pure python, it would be extremely slow.  
But one thing is for sure, you can run it by simply typing ***python main.py***

The program runs in terminal and all images you see are text presented by print function.  
Usually, "█" is used as it's the character that resembles a real pixel the most.  
But you can use any characters you favor alternatively by replacing all "██" into whatever you want, which should be easy to accomplish with a proper IDE or text editor.  
Just remember to replace it with something as wide as it, "**", "()" for examples. If you replace it with something narrower, such as "0", the image would be compressed horizontally.

Logic behind the code is mostly based on @javidx9's Code-It-Yourself! 3D Graphics Engine Part
